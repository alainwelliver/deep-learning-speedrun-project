  "modification": "Using the modified translation module but with deterministic_translate flag disabled. This serves as a control to verify the implementation doesn't introduce bugs or performance regressions when operating in baseline mode.",
  "description": "This ablation experiment verifies that our deterministic translation module works correctly when the flag is disabled. It should produce identical results to the baseline, confirming that: (1) the module correctly falls back to random translation when deterministic_translate=false, and (2) no unintended side effects were introduced during implementation.",
