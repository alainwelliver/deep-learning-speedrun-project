    "hypothesis": "Adding a residual skip connection with max pooling between the first and second convolutional layers will improve training speed by 10-15%",
    
    "modification": "Added residual connection between conv1 and conv2 with max pooling to match feature dimensions. This allows gradients to flow more directly between early layers, potentially accelerating convergence.",
    
    "description": "We hypothesize that the first and second layers learn similar features during training. By adding a residual connection with max pooling (to match the spatial dimensions after pooling), we enable more direct gradient flow. This should accelerate early-stage learning without significantly increasing computational cost.",
